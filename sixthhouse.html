        <img src="img/sixthhouse/BarnOwl.png" alt="BarnOwl" class="size50">
        <h3>Tai</h3>
        <p>
            The most experienced member of the team, he had been working as a superhero in Bangkok for 6 years before transferring to Khon Kaen into the 6th house.
        </p>
        <img src="img/sixthhouse/MuayLek.png" alt="MuayLek" class="size50">
        <h3>MuayLek</h3>
        <p>
            She is the most adept of the team, having trained, and mastered, various kinds of martial arts in order to both help the innocent and live up to her father's standards.
        </p>
        <img src="img/sixthhouse/Swift.png" alt="Vayu" class="size50">
        <h3>Vayu</h3>
        <p>
            Having been trained by a secret organization since childhood, he is the deadliest member of the team, despite having no special powers himself.
        </p>
        <img src="img/sixthhouse/Ai.png" alt="Aiyarin" class="size50">
        <h3>Aiyarin</h3>
        <p>
            Ai was gifted with immense power but also its curse - she couldn't control it. However, she still trains everyday, each training harder than the last, in hopes of mastering it eventually.
        </p>
        <img src="img/sixthhouse/Phuwiang.png" alt="Phuwiang" class="size50">
        <h3>Phuwiang</h3>
        <p>
            A terrible accident befell a brave boy, leaving his body paralyzed in a hospital. His conscience and courage, however, was uploaded into a massive robotic titan modeled after one of Khon Kaen's most renowned prehistoric beasts.
        </p>
        <img src="img/sixthhouse/Rama.png" alt="Ram" class="size50">
        <h3>Ram</h3>
        <p>
            A boy with a genius intellect, Ram graduated in everything required at the age of 14 and lived a carefree and cocky life. His mistakes eventually backfired, and before he lost himself, Muay Lek took him into the 6th house and treated him as her younger
            brother.
